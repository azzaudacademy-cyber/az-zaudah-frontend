            Welcome to Az-Zaudah Academy — a warm, caring, structured platform created to make Qur’anic and Islamic learning truly accessible. If you are searching for a teacher who corrects gently, a course that moves patiently, or a place where children and adults are taught with tarbiyyah (nurture), you are in the right place. Our core model is online one-to-one teaching (live classes, personalised feedback, digital Mushaf with mistake-marking). For families who prefer in-person learning, we also connect you to a verified network of nearby teachers, maktabs, and accredited madrasahs — carefully evaluated and linked once approved. Learn securely, steadily, and with dignity.
